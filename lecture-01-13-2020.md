## Write back protocols

- To handle writing multiple times into the same memory location

#### MSI
- Simplest write back protocol is MSI
- Three states
    - **Modified** - current cache has valid copy; main memory out of date
    - **Shared** - location is unmodified; up to date with main memory; other caches may also have this date (also up to date)
    - **Invalid** - same as before
    
#### MESI

- Most commonly used
- Has four states (extra Exclusive state)
    - **Exclusive** - only this cache has valid copy; main memory is up-to-date
    
#### MESIF

- Used in the latest i7 processors
- Adds an **Forward** state
    - Basically a shared state; but, current cache is the only one that will respond to a request to transfer the data
