# Modern processors

- Includes Slide 2 and 3

- Effective access time of memory: $$h\times t_c + (1-h)\times t_m$$

- **SMP** (Symmetric multiprocessing) - Most common of multiprocessing system
    - Cores are interconnected using buses
    - Shares the same memory
    
### Manually Give Hints to Compiler

```
long __builtin_expect(long exp, long c)
```

- The expected result is that exp = c
- Need to run at at least compiler optimization level 2

### Branch Predictions
- With no branch prediction, we need to serialize the instructions
- If the prediction is correct we save time
- If the prediction is wrong the bad prediction gets thrown out

### Spectre
- Uses branch prediction to try to access a memory offset of an unauthorized page, and checks to see if the pages are loaded to determine the bit of a corresponding offset
