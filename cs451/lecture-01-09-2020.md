# MapReduce

- There needs to be an algorithm to divide the workload into bins to be assigned to different servers

#### Combiner
 - runs after the map phase
 - compresses the data to reduce network traffic
 - can only process data on the specific mapper it runs after
 - mini reducer
 - you should write code so that the process will work correctly even if the combiner is not being ran (Combiner does not always get ran)
